quick overview of babyshark campaign disguise as defense-themed hwp document, involving the kimsuky apt group; author: n/a; date: january 13, 2025; source: n/a; group: kimsuky apt group; family: babyshark
summary: hwp with embedded ole drops babyshark downloader that fetches c2 payloads and selectively installs final payloads (e.g., quasarrat).
key:
    1) 1212.bat uses curl to hxxps[:]//www[.]elmer[.]com[.]tr/.../dksleks?newpa=comline -> %appdata%/microsoft/wis.db
    2) persistence via task scheduler "temporarystatescleanesdfrs"; target ip checks for selective delivery
    3) avoid unverified attachments; block unverified object/link execution

behavior flow:
1) kimsuky create hwp document 'announcement of the korean defense industry society’s defense industry digital innovation seminar plan' — attached hwp contains malicious ole object
2) 1212.bat http_request hxxps[:]//www[.]elmer[.]com[.]tr/modules/mod_finder/src/helper/1212_pprb_all/dksleks?newpa=comline — downloader script invoked when hyperlink in pdf is clicked
3) 1212.bat create %appdata%/microsoft/wis.db — store fetched payload
4) babyshark read local ip address — verify target for selective payload delivery
5) babyshark http_request hxxps[:]//www[.]elmer[.]com[.]tr/modules/mod_finder/src/helper/1212_pprb_all/dksleks?newpa=comline — retrieve malicious payload from c2
6) babyshark create scheduled task 'temporarystatescleanesdfrs' — register task scheduler entry to maintain persistence
7) babyshark launch vb script via manifest file — execute vbscript through manifest to run additional actions
8) babyshark create quasarrat — historical final payload delivered to specific targets (observed in previous incidents)
